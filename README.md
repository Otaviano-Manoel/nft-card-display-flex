## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

In this HTML with CSS project, I chose to improve my use of display: flex and its ways of aligning flexible elements.

Alignment method applied in this project.
```css
.background {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

Alignment method applied in my last project.
```css
main {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue working on HTML and CSS projects to improve myself. And now I'm going to look for a challenge that requires greater mobile responsiveness.
