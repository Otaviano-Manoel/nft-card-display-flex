### What I learned

In this project, I practiced the use of display: flex, which is a great property for aligning and arranging child elements. I used this to center them in the middle of the screen.

I centered it using `display: flex` in the middle of the screen.
```css
.background {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

For my next project, I will seek to work on responsiveness. It's a property that styles a website differently for each screen resolution.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - 
I used W3Schools to clarify my doubts and I really liked their examples, which clarify how to use CSS properties.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - I'd like you to get to know MDN Web Docs, which helped me a lot in understanding HTML tags.
